                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>In this game, your objective is to get your 'hand' (the cards you've played) as close to 21 as
                    possible, without exceeding it.</p>
                <p>All cards are worth their face value as they would be in a real deck of cards.</p>
                <p>'Royal' cards are always worth 10, and aces are worth 10 if your hand total is equal to 11 or less at
                    the time you draw them. If your hand is worth more than 11, then aces are worth 1.</p>
                <p>The game starts with two cards dealt to each player, and the player always takes their turn first.
                </p>
                <p>Choosing 'Hit' will deal you another card, which will then count to your total. If your new hand
                    total makes your hand total exceed 21, you have 'bust' and lost the round.</p>
                <p>Choosing 'Stand' will mean you will no longer take any turns until your opponent also stands, or goes
                    'bust'.</p>
                <p>In the event that both players stand, the player with the highest hand total under 21 wins!</p>
                <p>If you wish to review these rules again after starting, simply click/tap 'Rules' at the top of the page.</p>
